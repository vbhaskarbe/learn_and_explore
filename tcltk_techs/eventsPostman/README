   FspfEventPostMan  -  Event Simulator && Transporter for Fspf Agent(s). 

*** WHAT IS FspfEventPostMan ???
    
		 FspfEventPostMan is a set of Event Simulator (GUI) and Event 
     Transporter (C Binary)to generate the events and post them to FspfAgent(s) 
     running on Linux System(s). It Offers flexibility of testing a wide range 
     of events faster and easier. TESTER need not worry about the port 
     connections or how agent is receiving events. All she needs to do is to 
     copy a Config.cfg ( or write one ) to this directory and start the 
     Agents (With Their DomainId Passed as Command Line Argument) and then
     start the FspfEventSimulator. After that its all Mouse Clicks.;-)

*** FEATURES IN GUI  :-	
        
        1. GUI need not be on the same system in which the fspfAgent(s)
	  are running.And a Single instance of GUI is enough to Post 
	  events to any of the fspfAgents.

        2. No Entry Fields. Just Select Source Domain And/Or
          Source Port, Rest of the fields are updated automatically.

        3. An "eventLogs" file Generated when you Quit GUI. Which
          contains summary of all the EVENTS you sent in this session. 
          A backup of previous event log file (prevEventLogs) is provided 
          to help hasty USER.
    
        4. TESTER can test for some time then close the GUI. After
          sometime, may be days ;-), restart GUI again and start
          from where she left.
            
        5. No Key Board Typos. Does not need any Extra information 
          apart from Config.cfg File. Only Mouse clicks. 
    
        6. The eventTransporter is executed (run & exited) when USER selects an event.
          othertimes its not running. No Idle Process.           
    
        7.  A SourceDomain Label, which can be clicked to see all the
           information about a Domain Selected in the corresponding
           listbox.        
        
        8. A Status information is Displayed on the screen to show the
           current action.

        9. State tramsitions of a particular Eport can be seen by clicking 
          the Snapshot button.

	       
*** EVENTS THAT CAN BE SENT FROM GUI :-
        
        PortUp           => Sent to BOTH fspfAgents (i.e, with sDomain and dDomain). *
        PortDown         =>            "
        EportUp          =>            "
        EportDown        =>            "
        DomainAssigned   => Sent ONLY to fspfAgent with DomainId sDomain. **
        Snapshot         =>	       "	 
        DomainInvalid    =>            "  
        RtReqNumEntries  =>            "    
        RtTable          =>            "
        GetRoute         =>            "
        PortUpMask       =>            "
        BrdcastPortMask  =>            "
        Quit             => To close the GUI.

    
     IMPORTANT NOTE:

         * Before sending PortUp/Down or EportUp/Down make sure that you sent 
      DomainAssigned to corresponding (source domain & destn domain) fspfAgents 
      SEPARATELY (since it is sent ONLY to Source Domain fspfAgent by default. 
      Well, in Real Switch domain assigned is individual event to that switch only,
      Right!), unless you are doing some kind of Negative testing like what happens 
      if one swith receives PortUp but other switch to which it is connected is not
      yet ready(though it is unlikely to happen in real scenario).

        ** Once PortUP, EportUp are sent then corresponding fspfAgents will start
      getting timeout events from its own MBOX, and packets from OTHER fspfAgent(s),
      as they start communicating with each other (without EventPostMan's intervention).
      Especially when EportUp is sent the agents will exchange TDB etc and after a while 
      comes to a Stable state. Hence when other EVENTS ( GetRoute etc) are sent some 
      time AFTER sending PortUp & EportUP, before user could actually see the output of
      that EVENT at fspfAgent terminal and ANALYSE, other timer events may occcur or
      packets may be received from other fspfAgent(s) causing the output to SCROLL OFF.      
      fiddle with Scroll Bar. ;-)
    
        *** By DEFAULT, The GUI fills up the fields that are Displayed, with SourceDomain 
     as least domain (in Config.cfg file) and SourcePort as least port in 'this' source 
     domain. Based on these two fields other fields are filled. When other source domain
     is selected, Then source port is updated as to contain the least port on this newly 
     selected domain. Then other fields are updated accordingly. Afcourse one can select 
     other port (if exists) from the sourcePortList too.Then other fields are updated to 
     reflect this newly selected source port. 

       **** The Fields Source_Ip, DestDomain, Dest_Port, Dest_IP are 'SEEONLY'. User can 
     not change them directly. Afcourse you can change indirectly by selecting New Source 
     Domain or Source Port.
	
      ***** Though GUI can handle as many events as USER clicks, its advised to give some
     delay between each of the events. This is because GUI sends events to eventTransporter 
     which then sends to transport layer of corresponding fspfagent, which then posts it to 
     agent's MBOX. Only after these activities the fspfagent will receive the actual EVENT 
     sent.

        File   :  fspfEventSimulator.tk
        Type   :  Tk Script
        Desc   :  It is a Tk Script Which Displays the Widget
             with buttons, text bixes, and list boxes. Buttons will
             correspond to the Events for the FSPF Agent.
             Events are choosen by pressing corresponding buttons.
             ( it sources configReader.tcl before starting widget ).

             This gets all the required information from command line
             arguments ( passed from GUI ) and opens a socket 
	       ( baseaddress + domainId ) to the given source domain 
             ( the same socket on which corresponding Domain's fspfAgent 
   	       is listening) and Posts her the Event 
             and It's Information ( If Event is Port UP/DOWN or
             EPort UP/DOWN then sends to destination Domain also ) 
             then exits.
             
#######**********************************************************##########    


      NOTE   :- No need of any config files at fspfAgents directory. But
               you need to start the fspfAgents with their domainId passed as 
               command line arguments, before Using EventSimulator GUI. 

      Example:- Starting an fspfAgent with domainId 2 in testHarness directory.
               ( this domainId 2 should be present in Config.cfg and the system 
               in which you are starting this fspfAgent should have Ip Address
               as specified for this domain(2) in the Config.cfg ).

               (PromptString)$ ./fspfAgent 2     
         

*** HOW TO EDIT CONFIG FILE ??? ( Manually )

     The Information into Config file is to be entered as folows :
     
        sourceDomain: sourceIP: destDomain sourcePort destPort;destDomain sourcePort destPort;

        Explanation:- 
    Next two values are  Once/Domain :-
        sourceDomain :- Source Domain Id
        sourceIP     :- Source IP Address

    Next three values are a pair. One_Entry/Port_Connection.
        destDomain   :- Destination Domain
        sourcePort   :- Source Port
        destPort     :- destPort

    ***EXAMPLE FOR WRITING CONFIG FILE :- 
    
        Suppose you want to Connect....

    FROM a switch with

        domainId 1, IpAddress 172.16.2.16, SourcePort 2 

    TO a switch with

        domainId 2, IpAddress 172.16.2.178, DestnPort 3 

    THEN corresponding entries in the Config file should be

    1:172.16.2.16:2 2 3;
    2:172.16.2.178:1 3 2;

    Now u want to make one more connection, Suppose
    FROM

        domainId 1, IpAddress 172.16.2.16, SourcePort 4

    TO

        domainId 2, IpAddress 172.16.2.178, DestnPort 5

    THEN the updated Config file should look like

    1:172.16.2.16:2 2 3;2 4 5;
    2:172.16.2.178:1 3 2;1 5 4;
    
    Similarly add more connections. ;-)

#####    IMPORTANT ==>

         1.     IpAddress of Source and Destination can be same, to support
        Multiple instances on same system.

         2.  Source Port and Destination Port can be same, provided Source Domain 
        and Destination Domain are different. i,e) You can connect from Source 
        Port 2 to Destination Port 2.

         3.  DONT use different delimeters and newlines. Use what is 
         explained above. Its strictly one line/domain. If line 
         exceeds more than one line DON'T use <ENTER> use '\' instead.

         4.  No validations are being done on the numbers ( from Config.cfg). 
        This is to allow the TESTER luxury of NEGATIVE Testing of FSPF Agents.

         5. Make sure that IP Addresses given for Domains are reachable from
        FspfEventPostMan.( use 'ping IP_ADDRESS' and check ).
    
         6. Make sure that you have latest transport layer ( compatible with GUI )
        at the fspfAgent's side (in testHarness directory).         
             
                
    
*** INSTALLATION STEPS : ( FspfEventPostMan only. )
        
        1. Go to FspfEventPostMan Directory.
        
            cd FspfEventPostMan
        
        2. Make FspfEventSimulator.tk Executable    
            
            chmod 0777 FspfEventSimulator.tk
        
        3. Run FspfEventSimulator.tk

            ./FspfEventSimulator.tk

         
        If You are running it for the first time, it takes few seconds
    before you see the GUI ( Graphical User Interface ), because it 
    builds the Binary "EventTransporter" from source "EventTransporter.c"
    first time.

        When USER Quits From the GUI she will find a file named "eventLogs" which
    gives the summary of Events she has sent during this session.     
    

*** USING eventTransporter Without GUI :
	
	Incase Tester wants to test the fspfAgents without using the GUI, she can do so by
      following steps.
	
	1. Check for executable "eventTransporter" in fspfEventPostMan directory.

      2. If it is not there then check if eventTransporter.c is there. make an executable 
           'eventTransporter' from 'eventTransporter.c' by, ( assuming u have a 'C' compiler 
           installed. Otherwise call sysadmin).          

           cc -o eventTransporter eventTransporter.c
         
	3. Now,
           one can send events using the 'eventTransporter' executable created in step 2 
           by following the syntax given below.

        For Sending Events 
		PortUp, 
		PortDown, 
		EportUp, 
		EportDown, 
		GetRoute

        Use the Syntax :
          eventTransporter EventEVENTNAME SourceDomain SourceIpAddress SourcePort \
			   DestDomain DestIpAddress DestPort

        and    
        For Sending Events 
		DomainAssigned, 
	        Snapshot,
	        DomainInvalid,  
	        RtReqNumEntries, 
	        RtTable, 
	        PortUpMask, 
	        BrdcastPortMask

       Use The Syntax :    
	 eventTransporter EventEVENTNAME SourceDomain SourceIpAddress SourcePort


       EXAMPLE :
	
	=>  Suppose u want to send 'PortUp' to sourceDomain '1' with Ip '172.16.2.187' and 
           sourcePort '10' and to destDomain '2' with Ip '172.16.2.192' and destPort '11'
           then at command-line execute the command, (Make sure that domaiIds are Unique)
          
          eventTransporter EventPortUp 1 172.16.2.187 10 2 172.16.2.192 11

        =>  Suppose u want to send 'DomainAssigned' to sourceDomain '1' with Ip '172.16.2.187'
	   with sourcePort '10' then execute the command,
	 
	  eventTransporter EventDomainAssigned 1 172.16.2.187 10

        NOTE :-

	    1. All the Above said rules under the section Important in  
              "HOW TO EDIT A CONFIG FILE" MUST be followed here also.

	    2. User herself has to keep track of the events she sent. No diagnostic information
              is displayed by the trasporter, it just sends Event ( if values are correct, and
              it is able to reach that domain) and Quits.

	    3. A Shell or PERL script can be Used to do Automation.

	    4. User is Adviced to use GUI always, so that she knows for sure what she is doing.
              
          5. If the Configuration is complex, i.e, there are many domains and many ports 
              connected between them, then some basic configuration can be automated using 
	      Scripts ( she can log the events too, by some coding ) and then GUI can be 
              started to TEST from that BASE point.

*** Future Enhancements:

	     1.  An Option to run the GUI in silent mode with config.cfg details and at the 
		  end of all events start the GUI or exit.

	     2. Minor Adjustments to make it run on WindowsXp.
