Good morning. Good morning. In less than an hour aircrafts from here will 
join others from around the world and you will be launching the largest aerial 
battle in the history of mankind. Mankind, that word should have new meaning 
for all of us today. We can’t be consumed by our petty differences anymore. 
We will be united in our common interests. Perhaps it’s fate that today is the 
4th of July and you will once again be fighting for our freedom. Not from 
tyranny, oppression, or persecution. But from annihilation. We’re fighting for
our right to live, to exist. And should we win today the 4th of July will no 
longer be known as an American holiday, but as the day when the world declared
in one voice, “We will not go quietly into the night. We will not vanish without
a fight. We’re going to live on. We’re going to survive. Today we celebrate 
our INDEPENDENCE DAY.
